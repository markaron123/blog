                <h3 style="text-align: center;">My Life until I reach UC</h3>
                <p>   In the warm morning of May tenth, in the year 1999 at Pines Doctors Hospital a baby boy was born. His mother and father were very happy because that baby is their very first baby. Although their family is just average, not rich and not that poor, they are very happy. On that day that childâ€™s life has begun and that was me. My name is Mark Aron Acfiawen Calawen, My mother is just a house wife named Merge A. Calawen and my father a carpenter named Jerome O. Calawen.</p>
              <p>In the year 2001, my younger sister was born and may parents named her Jema Kate A. Calawen. A year has passed and I am already 3 years old, I started going to a nursery school at Roxas Day Care Center for only three months. Another year has passed and this time my younger brother was born named Jerome A. Calawen Junior. 4 years of age I started studying again but this time at DENR Day Care Center. I studied there for 2 years and it was very exciting and I enjoyed it a lot.</p>
                <p>At the age of six I entered Dr. Jose P. Rizal Elementary School and studied there. I was transferred to the star section because I can read 3 letter words and 4 letter words. In my second grade my teacher was very strict because she pinches us and makes us squat when me are late. That is also the year when my mother goes abroad. After 2 years my mother came back and I am so happy. I even skipped classes for 2 days. On my sixth grade, my youngest brother was born and he was named Jeremy A. Calawen. Before I graduate in elementary our teacher asked us what would we want in the future. What I answered was Information Technology because my mom said that I am interested in computers then I should take I.T. in the future.</p>
                
                <p>I entered high school at Saint Louise School of Pacdal Incorporated. I am already on my fourth year when my mother said that it will be hard for me to enter a university because of lack of budget. That is why when our neighbour asks if I want to get a scholarship, I took the opportunity and take the exam for the scholarship even though I am not that good in academics. Fortunately I passed and I can now go to a university but needs to maintain a grade. After graduation I am choosing a course on what to take like Information technology, Computer Science, and Computer Engineering. I still choose I.T. because since elementary it is already my first choice even though I do not know what I.T. really is. Now I am already 16 and I am now studying at the University of the Cordilleras with a course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>
